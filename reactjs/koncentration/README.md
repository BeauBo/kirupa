This is the source code for the [**Koncentration**](https://www.kirupa.com/react/koncentration/index.html) game. It's a throwback to the old memory card games you may have played, so you may like this game.

To use these files, [create a new React app](https://www.kirupa.com/react/setting_up_react_environment.htm).

Once you have created your project, replace your **src** and **public** folders with the contents found here. Point your terminal to your app's root folder and just run `npm start`. (If you don't know what this means, the [*create new React app*](https://www.kirupa.com/react/setting_up_react_environment.htm) instructions from earlier will help you out).

If you have any questions or run into issues, please post your question on the forums: https://forum.kirupa.com
